/*
When doing these tasks, we recommend using console.log to test the output of your code to make sure it works correctly.
This will usually entail console logging the answer directly or console logging the invocation (call) of the function so when it
returns a value, that value will be logged to the console.  An example of this would be:  console.log(theFunction(value1,value2))

  REMEMBER: This program should handle correctly adult AND puppy ages and weights
  
  Feeding Requirements:

  Adult Dogs 1 year and older 
     up to 5 lbs - 5% of their body weight

     7 - 12 months 4% of their body weight
